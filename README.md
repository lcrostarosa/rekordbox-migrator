## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** (with Python support)
- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **Internet connection** (for dependency installation)

### What You Need
1. **Rekordbox XML file** - Your exported library
2. **New music directory path** - Where your music files are now located
3. **Music files** - The actual audio files that should exist at the new path

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone or download this repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd rekordbox-editor

# Install dependencies and verify setup
make install
make test
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x rekordbox_path_updater.py
chmod +x rekordbox_path_updater.sh
```

## üìñ Detailed Usage

### Understanding Your Rekordbox

Your Rekordbox XML contains entries like this:
```xml
<TRACK Location="file://localhost/D:/Old%20Mix/03%20Together%20We%20Stand.mp3" />
```

The tool will:
1. Extract `03%20Together%20We%20Stand.mp3` (URL decoded to `03 Together We Stand.mp3`)
2. Look for this file at your new path
3. Update the Location to point to the new location
4. Leave unchanged if the file doesn't exist

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Prepare Your Files
```bash
# Ensure your music files are in the new location
ls "/Volumes/External/Music/"
# Should show your .mp3, .wav, .aiff, .m4a files
```

#### 2. Test with Dry Run
```bash
make dry-run XML_FILE="rekordbox.xml" NEW_PATH="/Volumes/External/Music/"
```

This will show you:
- ‚úì Files that will be updated (found at new location)
- ‚úó Files that won't be updated (not found at new location)
- Summary of what will happen

#### 3. Run the Actual Update
```bash
make update XML_FILE="rekordbox.xml" NEW_PATH="/Volumes/External/Music/"
```

This will:
- Create a of your original file (`rekordbox.xml.backup`)
- Update all found files
- Leave unchanged files that don't exist
- Show a detailed report

### Command Line Options

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Safety Features
- **Automatic**: Original file is always backed up before changes
- **Dry-run mode**: Test changes before applying them
- **File verification**: Only updates files that exist at new location
- **Error reporting**: Comprehensive list of files that couldn't be found

### What Gets Updated
- Files that exist at the new location ‚Üí **Updated**
- Files that don't exist at new location ‚Üí **Left unchanged**
- Non-music files ‚Üí **Left unchanged**

### Supported File Formats
- `.mp3` - MP3 audio files
- `.wav` - WAV audio files
- `.aiff` - AIFF audio files
- `.m4a` - M4A audio files
- `.flac` - FLAC audio files
- And other audio formats

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "XML file not found"
```bash
# Check if the file exists and has the correct name
ls -la "rekordbox.xml"
```

#### "New root path is not a valid directory"
```bash
# Verify the directory exists and is accessible
ls -la "/Volumes/External/Music/"
```

#### "No files were updated"
This usually means:
1. Files don't exist at the new location
2. Filenames don't match exactly (case sensitivity)
3. Path is incorrect

#### "Permission denied"
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x rekordbox_path_updater.py
chmod +x rekordbox_path_updater.sh
```

### Getting Help

#### Check File Locations
```bash
# List files in your new music directory
find "/Volumes/External/Music/" -name "*.mp3" | head -10

# Check if specific files exist
ls "/Volumes/External/Music/03 Together We Stand.mp3"
```

#### Verify XML Structure
```bash
# Check if your XML file is valid
python -c "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET; ET.parse('rekordbox.xml')"
```

# Or use the makefile
make restore
```

## üöÄ Performance Features

### Smart Multithreading
Both scripts automatically calculate the optimal number of worker threads based on your system resources:

**Automatic Thread Calculation:**
- **CPU Cores**: Base calculation on available CPU cores
- **Memory Factor**: Adjusts based on available RAM (more RAM = more threads possible)
- **I/O Optimization**: Adds 50% more threads for file system operations
- **Smart Bounds**: Minimum 2 threads, maximum 32 threads or 4x CPU cores

**Python Script:**
```bash
# Let the script choose optimal thread count (recommended)
python3 rekordbox_path_updater.py "rekordbox backup.xml" "/new/path/"

# Override with custom thread count
python3 rekordbox_path_updater.py "rekordbox backup.xml" "/new/path/" --workers 16
```

**Bash Script:**
```bash
# Let the script choose optimal thread count (recommended)
./rekordbox_path_updater.sh "rekordbox backup.xml" "/new/path/"

# Override with custom thread count
./rekordbox_path_updater.sh "rekordbox backup.xml" "/new/path/" 8
```

**Makefile:**
```bash
# Let the script choose optimal thread count (recommended)
make update XML_FILE="rekordbox backup.xml" NEW_PATH="/new/path/"

# Override with custom worker count
make update XML_FILE="rekordbox backup.xml" NEW_PATH="/new/path/" WORKERS=16
```

**System Requirements for Optimal Performance:**
- **psutil** (optional): For better memory detection in Python script
- **bc** (optional): For better calculations in bash script
- **nproc/sysctl**: For CPU core detection

### Debug Mode
For troubleshooting and detailed analysis, use debug mode:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
python3 rekordbox_path_updater.py "rekordbox backup.xml" "/new/path/" --debug

# Debug with single-threaded mode
python3 rekordbox_path_updater.py "rekordbox backup.xml" "/new/path/" --debug --single-thread

# Debug with dry-run
python3 rekordbox_path_updater.py "rekordbox backup.xml" "/new/path/" --debug --dry-run
```

**Debug Features:**
- **File-by-file logging**: Every file processed is logged
- **Subdirectory tracking**: Shows which subdirectories are being searched
- **Detailed timing**: Each step is timed and logged
- **Error tracing**: Complete error paths and causes
- **Performance metrics**: Detailed processing statistics

### Performance Tips
- **Large Libraries**: For libraries with 10,000+ tracks, the smart threading can provide 3-5x speed improvement
- **SSD vs HDD**: Performance gains are more noticeable on slower storage
- **Memory**: More RAM allows for more concurrent file operations
- **Network Drives**: Consider using fewer threads for network-mounted storage

## üìä Logging and Reporting
